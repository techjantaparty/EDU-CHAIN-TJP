***Our project Gurudev is a blockchain-based ed-tech and job-seeking platform built with Gaianet decentralized LLMs and Edu Chain. It aims to revolutionize the education and employment sectors by leveraging the power of decentralized technologies to provide secure, transparent, and efficient solutions for learners and job seekers. By integrating blockchain technology, Gurudev ensures that all educational credentials and job-related data are immutable and verifiable, reducing fraud and increasing trust among users. The platform also utilizes decentralized learning management systems (LLMs) to offer personalized and adaptive learning experiences, catering to the unique needs of each learner. Furthermore, Gurudev connects job seekers with potential employers through a decentralized job marketplace, where job postings and applications are securely managed on the blockchain. This not only enhances the efficiency of the job-seeking process but also ensures that all transactions are transparent and tamper-proof. In summary, Gurudev is set to transform the way education and employment are approached by harnessing the capabilities of blockchain and decentralized technologies, ultimately creating a more secure, transparent, and efficient ecosystem for all stakeholders involved.***

## üßê Problem Statement

It is useful to design and follow a specific format when writing a problem statement. While there are several options
for doing this, the following is a simple and straightforward template often used in Business Analysis to maintain
focus on defining the problem.

- IDEAL: This section is used to describe the desired or ‚Äúto be‚Äù state of the process or product. At large, this section
  should illustrate what the expected environment would look like once the solution is implemented.
- REALITY: This section is used to describe the current or ‚Äúas is‚Äù state of the process or product.
- CONSEQUENCES: This section is used to describe the impacts on the business if the problem is not fixed or improved upon.
  This includes costs associated with loss of money, time, productivity, competitive advantage, and so forth.

Following this format will result in a workable document that can be used to understand the problem and elicit
requirements that will lead to a winning solution.

## üí°Solution

This section is used to describe potential solutions.

Once the ideal, reality, and consequences sections have been
completed, and understood, it becomes easier to provide a solution for solving the problem.

## ‚õìÔ∏è Dependencies / Limitations <a name = "limitations"></a>

- What are the dependencies of your project?
- Describe each limitation in detailed but concise terms
- Explain why each limitation exists
- Provide the reasons why each limitation could not be overcome using the method(s) chosen to acquire.
- Assess the impact of each limitation in relation to the overall findings and conclusions of your project, and if
  appropriate, describe how these limitations could point to the need for further research.

## üöÄ Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>

Write about what you could not develop during the course of the Hackathon; and about what your project can achieve
in the future.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development
and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```shell
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Add notes about how to use the system.
